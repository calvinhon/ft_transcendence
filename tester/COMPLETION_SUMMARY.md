## Test Execution Paths

### Path A: Quick Validation (5 minutes)
```
1. docker-compose ps (verify all services running)
2. Run health checks (all 4 services + infrastructure)
3. Quick smoke tests (basic functionality)
→ Result: Services operational ✅
```

### Path B: Module Testing (varies)
```
1. Select one test file
2. Follow all 12 tests in sequence
3. Document results
→ Result: Module validated ✅
```

### Path C: Full Suite (2-3 hours)
```
1. Execute all 14 test files
2. Run all 144 tests
3. Comprehensive validation
→ Result: Complete system tested ✅
```

### Path D: Continuous (ongoing)
```
1. Monitor services during development
2. Run quick validation regularly
3. Full suite before deployment
→ Result: Quality assured ✅
```
